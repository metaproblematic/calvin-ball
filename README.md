From a fictional game with crazy rules, played in the comic strip Calvin and Hobbes.

Calvinball Rules:
1. A player's score is equal to 500 if their score is not already a number.
2. A player's score is reduced by 300 if they are crying. Otherwise it is increased by 50.
3. A player's score is reduced by 77 if their last play was "Q"
4. A player gets an extra 395 points if they are in a tree, unless their last play was a number.
5. A player's score is doubled if they are holding the broom handle, but it is tripled if they have the broom brush. Otherwise the player's score is halved.
6. A player's score is multiplied by 1.5 if they are carrying the ball but only if they are not in a tree. Disregard this rule if the player is crying.
7. If the player's last play was a number (not a letter), the player's score is multiplied by that amount.
